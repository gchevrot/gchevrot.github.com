    I am a computational biophysicist (postdoc fellow) working at MEMPHYS_ -
    Center for Biomembrane Physics - at the `University of Southern Denmark`_ 
    Currently I am in the biophysics `group of H. Khandelia`_ and I perform
    molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics and structure of 
    proteins and membrane proteins.
    
    My research interests are now in biomolecular simulations but I previously
    sharpened my skills (programming, statistical mechanics, numerical
    simulations) on different subjects. I obtained my PhD at the `University of
    Strasbourg`_ where I studied the liquid-liquid interface as part of the
    extraction of ions from one phase to another. Then I studied the
    structural and thermodynamic behavior of carbon nanoparticles under high
    pressure and temperature. I also worked on the dynamics of proteins
    (internal motions, diffusion tensors) and impact of anisotropic motions on
    incoherent neutron scattering intensities.

    When not working in the lab, I enjoy learning new things, reading books,
    cycling, drinking a glass of Burgundy wine and spending some quality time 
    with my family and friends.
