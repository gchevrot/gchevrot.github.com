    I am a computational biophysicist (postdoc fellow) working in Synchrotron SOLEIL 
    at CNRS. Currently I am in the biophysics `group of G. Kneller`_ and I am part 
    of the Sputnik_ project. 
    My research interests include the dynamics of proteins and the coupling 
    between molecular simulation and experiments. I really enjoy molecular
    simulations as a virtual microscope of life and I hope I will still be 
    around when we will be able to simulate the whole machinery of cells!
    In my daily life, my work includes application of existing packages like Gromacs, 
    NAMD, MMTK, nMoldyn ... but also the development of new codes (especially with 
    python at the moment) for analysis, storage problems (HDF5) or web development 
    (Django).
