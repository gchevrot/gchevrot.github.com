    I am a computational biophysicist (postdoc fellow) working at MEMPHYS_ -
    Center for Biomembrane Physics - at the `University of Southern Denmark`_ 
    Currently I am in the biophysics `group of H. Khandelia`_ and I am using
    molecular dynamics to study membrane proteins.
    My research interests are in biomolecular simulation. I enjoy molecular
    simulations as a virtual microscope of molecules and as a powerful 
    tool to explain and predict the properties of materials.
