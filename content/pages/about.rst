    Currently I am working at the Complex Systems Institute (MISC_) at the
    University of Orl√©ans in France. I am working on 3 different
    interdisciplinary projects. The first project tries to address the problem
    of reproducibility in computational science. The second project is related
    to text mining and the thrid projects deals with statistical analysis of
    neural signals.

    During my previous experience, I worked as a computational biophysicist at
    MEMPHYS_ - Center for Biomembrane Physics - at the `University of Southern
    Denmark`_ I was in the biophysics `group of H. Khandelia`_ and I
    perform molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics and structure
    of proteins and membranes.
    
    My research interests are in numerical simulations, modeling, statistical
    analysis and programming. I obtained my PhD at the `University of
    Strasbourg`_ where I studied the liquid-liquid interface as part of the
    extraction of ions from one phase to another. I also studied the
    structural and thermodynamic behavior of carbon nanoparticles under high
    pressure and temperature. I also worked on the dynamics of proteins
    (internal motions, diffusion tensors) and impact of anisotropic motions on
    incoherent neutron scattering intensities.

    When not working in the lab, I enjoy learning new things, reading books,
    exploring the country, cycling, drinking a glass of wine and spending some
    quality time with my family and friends.
