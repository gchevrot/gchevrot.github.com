    I am a computational biophysicist (postdoc fellow) working at `Synchrotron SOLEIL`_
    / CNRS_. Currently I am in the biophysics `group of G. Kneller`_ and I am part 
    of the Sputnik_ project. 
    My research interests include the dynamics of proteins and the coupling 
    between molecular simulation and experiments. I really enjoy molecular
    simulations as a virtual microscope of molecules and as a powerful 
    tool to build models in order to explain and predict the properties of
    materials.
    In my daily life, my work includes application of existing packages like AMBER, 
    Gromacs, MMTK, nMoldyn ... but also the writing of codes (Python, C,
    Mathematica) for analysis, storage problems (HDF5), web development 
    (Django) ...
